# quora
i am trying to build something like quora (quora.com)  for my college.
I am highly fascinated by the functionalities provided by quora. And it is a great medium for sharing knowledge. Thus, it inspired me to build this for my own college students.
Since i am still in learning phase, i am trying to provide basic question and answer facility where users can choose particular areas of interest at the begining (at the time of sign up). I have tried to build timeline. On particular timeline, there will be questions who that user has asked and also it includes answers given by him/her. As far as Newsfeed is concerned, it shows the questions which matches the areas of interest chosen by user initially.
I have used PHP for back-end development and HTML/CSS/Javascript for front-end development.
I am also learning Jquery and trying to make this page more responsive with the use of jquery.
